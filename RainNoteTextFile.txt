<b!>Peculiarities</b>
- Using double quotes breaks the text in Edit mode. 'Single quotes are fine.''
- Syntax appears to only work on one 'line' of text (meaning, adding a new 'physical' line will break syntax. Clipstring-created lines do not share this problem)
- If the same syntax is used more than once on a line all the text between the beginning of the first syntax and the ending of the last recieves that formatting.
- Using Clipstring any word, phrase, url, or whatever that is longer than the width of a line of text as displayed in this skin will not be continued on the next line.
- InputText does not support syntax (because it is a measure not a string meter)
